                    <h2>What is 60 Minute Website?</h2>
                    <p>60 Minute Website is an online event where you are challenged to make a website in one hour. You can use any technology you like, from WordPress to HTML to Python.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the hour, participants share what they have worked on. We anticipate projects are incomplete and rough around the edges. At the end of the day, you can say "I built a website in an hour!"</p>
                </div>
                <div style="flex: 1 50%;">
                    <p>No technical knowledge is required to participate.</p>

                    <p>Use the 60 Minute Website challenge as a way to:</p>
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start a presence on the web</li>
                        <li>Start working on a project that has been on your mind for a while</li>
                        <li>Try out a new technology</li>
                    </ul>

                    Most importantly, you should have fun ðŸŽ‰! What you build is up to you.

                    <h3>Before the Event</h3>
                    <p>Before the event, we encourage you to come up with an idea of what to build. This allows you to make the best use of the one hour available for making your website.</p>

                    <h3>Introductions</h3>
                        
                    <p>At the beginning of the meetup, participants are invited to introduce themselves. The organizer reads over the rules for the event, then starts a one hour timer. This starts your time to make something awesome!</p>
                        
                    <h3>Time to Create</h3>
                        
                    <p>Throughout the meeting, the organizer will give time updates.</p>
                        
                    <h3>Presentations</h3>
                        
                    <p>After one hour, everyone is invited to take their fingers off their keyboards (the fun, web way of "putting your pencils down" like you would after an exam) and share their projects. Sharing what you made is optional but highly encouraged!</p>
